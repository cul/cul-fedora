# Module to deal with accessing (and setting some defaults) in an array of
# hashes that describe Blacklight search fields.  Requires the base class this
# module is added to implements a #config method that returns a hash, where
# config[:search_fields] will be an array of hashes describing search fields.
#
# = Search Field Configuration Hash =
# { :display_label => "Title",  # user-displayable label
#   :qt => "search", # Solr qt param, request handler, defaults to Blacklight.config[:default_qt] if left blank.
#   :solr_parameters => {:qf => "something"} # optional hash of additional parameters to pass to solr for searches on this field.
#   :include_in_simple_select => false.  Defaults to true, but you can set to false to have a search field defined for deep-links or BL extensions, but not actually included in the HTML select for simple search choice. 
# }
# Optionally you can supply a :key, which is what Blacklight will use
# to identify this search field in HTTP query params. If no :key is
# supplied, one will be computed from the :display_label. If that will
# result in a collision of keys, you should supply one explicitly.
