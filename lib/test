A Source for Rubens's Modello of the Assumption and 

Coronation of the Virgin: a Case Study in the 

Response to Images* 

   O N E  of the standard art-historical exercises is the search for 
the pictorial sources of individual works of art. The purpose 
of this article is to suggest that this exercise need not con- 
stitute an end in itself, as it usually does, but that it can 
yield valuable information about the status of an image in a 
given social context and about the response it evokes. 
Rubens's modello of The Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin 
in Leningrad1 (Fig.2) raises a number of iconographic 
problems; these in turn are largely resolved by the dis- 
 covery of an important pictorial source for the work. That  
source and its relation to the work by Rubens may be used 
as an illustration of some of the ways in which it is possible to 
determine the associations which the seventeenth-century 
 beholder made when looking at works of art - even when 
they were not actually recorded by the beholder himself. 
While it can never be possible to recover the full range of 
 such associations - because many would have been too 
 personal and idiosyncratic - the art historian may regard 
 it as his province to reveal at  least some. 
The Leningrad modello has been shown beyond reasonable 
doubt to have been one of the two projects which Rubens 
presented to the Cathedral Chapter on nnnd April 161I for 
  the High Altar of Antwerp Cathedral.2 I t  is also likely that 
the painting of The Assumption of the Virgin in Vienna3 
(Fig.g), which reproduces the bottom half of the Leningrad 
composition, and which comes from the Lady Chapel of the 
Jesuit Church in Antwerp, was originally intended for the 
High Altar of the Cathedral.4 
* I am indebted to Michael Hirst for a number of pertinent observations on 
several of the issues raised here, and to Elizabeth McGrath for a critical read- 
ing of a late draft of the text. The Central Research Fund of the University of 
London made a grant towards the costs of research. The same source as the one 
discussed here was noted by T. L. GLEN:Rubens and the Counter Reformation.

originally presented as the author's thesis, Princeton University, 19751, p.151, 
which appeared after this article was written. But the purpose of the present 
discussion is not simply to identify a source for Rubens's composition; it is to 
examine some of the implications of this kind of relationship.

Well argued by BAUDOUIN, op. tit., pp.68-70, and VAN DE VELDE, op. cit. 
pp.253-56. The matter will be fully discussed in my forthcoming volume in 
the Corpus Rubenianum Ludwig Burchard (Vol.VI1). 
Apart from its pictorial brilliance, what is striking about 
the modello is its iconographic originality. As in all his later 
representations of the Assumption, Rubens has here combined 
the group of apostles surrounding the Madonna's tomb with 
a number of female figures. While these women are not 
usually shown to be present at the actual scene of the 
Assumption, nor are described thus in any of the textual 
sources,j their inclusion may be explained by the fact that 
they were said to have been present at the funeral of the 
Virgin, after having washed and shrouded her body.6 The 
rolling away of the stone cover of the sepulchre (here in- 
scribed MARIA) is also unusual, and so is the absence -
 or relative lack of prominence - of the sarcophagus in which 
she was laid to rest. But what is most unusual in the modello 
  is the upper half of the composition. I t  is true that the angels 
(and their variety) are emphasized in all the accounts and 
commentaries,' and the fact that the Virgin is on Christ's 
right depends on the reading from the forty-fourth psalm 
              in the liturgy for the Feast of the A s s u m p t i o n . ~ u t  what 
exactly is the scene? Is it an Assumption of the Virgin, a Corona- 
tion, or both? We know that in all Rubens's later Assumptions 
the Virgin ascends heavenwards towards a sculpted figure of 
          Christ, God, or the Trinity placed outside the ~ a i n t i n g . ~  
But here she kneels at the feet of Christ. If the scene is a 
Coronation, then it issurprising to find thevirgin being crowned 
 by Christ alone - for ever since the beginning of the fifteenth 
century, the standard Netherlandish Coronation was effected

    this also applies to the paintings in Brussels ( K l .  d. K [1921], p.120), Augsburg 
(Ibid., p.300) and Liechtenstein (Ibid., p.352) is considerable. At this point it 
should be added that the adoption of the lower half of the Leningrad modello 
and the rejection of the upper half for the painting first intended for the High 
Altar (i.e. the picture in Vienna) may have been due to the unusual nature of 
the iconography discussed here, but it may also have been as a result of a 
decision by the Cathedral Chapter to have a scubted figure or group crowning 
the Virgin, as in all the later works listed above.

by the whole Trinity.lo What, then, is the particular incono- 
graphic moment that Rubens has chosen to depict, and on 
what could he have based his representation ? Suchquestions 
may be regarded as splitting hairs about the meaning of a 
scene which is, after all, not very difficult to interpret. 
Rubens presumably knew Ludovico Carracci's altar-piece 
of 1601 in Corpus Domini in Bologna, which also shows the 
reception of the Virgin into heaven accompanied by music- 
making angels, as well as several other elements used by 
Rubens in his later assumption^.^^ But a specific answer is 
provided by the penultimate plate (Fig.6) in Jerome 
Nadal's Adnotationes et Meditationes in Evangelia, of which the 
illustrated section is entitled Evangelicae Historiae Imagines.12 
Hieronymus Wierix's engraving (after Bernardo Passeri13), 
provides not only the source of Rubens's composition, but 
also the key to the precise theme it represents. As the 
engraving by Wierix occurs in the sequence of four plates 
(Nos.150-53) devoted to the various stages in the Death, 
Burial, Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin, it also 
clarifies the position of this particular moment in the 
sequence.14 It is the third in the series, and is entitled 
Suscitatur Virgo Muter a Filio, while it is only the following 
plate which combines the scenes of the actual Assumption 
and Coronation (Fig.5). The textual discussion of this plate 
(as well as the caption on the plate itself) refers to the event

15de eeuwse schilderkunst der Nederlanden', Bulletin, Mushes Royaux des Beaux- 
Arts de Belgique, VIII [1g5g], pp.179-230, with both literary and pictorial 
examples. The same applies to Rubens's paintings of the Coronation itself in 
  Brussels and formerly in Berlin, Kl. d. K .  [1921], pp.270 and 341 respectively.

the work as a whole was HIERONYMUS NATALIS:Adnotationes et meditationes in

a later edition, published by the Plantin press in 1607, will be referred to here -
not only because it is chronologically closer to the work by Rubens, but also 
because it is a revised and corrected version (Editio ultima, in qua Sacer Textus ad 
emendationem Bibliorum Szxti V et Clementis VZZI restitutus) with an additional 
preface to be discussed here. For the various editions (and on Nadal himself), 
see the basic work by M. NICOLAU: Jerdnimo Nadal, S.I. (1507-1580)~sus obrasy

genesis and posthumous publication of the book may also be found. See now, 
for a recent assessment of its significance, T.BUSER: 'Jerome Nadal and Early 
Jesuit Art in Rome', The Art Bulletin, LVIII [1g76], pp.424-25, with still

l3 The size of each plate is 230 by 145 mm. Almost all the plates in book were by 
Wierix after drawings by Bernardo Passeri, 126 of which are at Windsor Castle 
(L. VAN PUYVELDE: The Flemish Drawings at Windsor, London [1g42], No.196.

l4 A not altogether dissimilar division into the different stages of scenes usually 
conflated may be found in the plates devoted to the Entsy into Jerusalem (P1.85-
87), the Carrying of the Cross (P1.124-26, and even the Three Maries at the 
Sepulchre (P1.136-37). All of these may naturally be used to determine the 
precise iconographic moment of other representations of these subjects, as in 
the case of the subject painted by Rubens under discussion here. 
as the reception of the Virgin into heaven by her Son.15 
I do not want to suggest that Rubens himself wished 
to distinguish consciously between the various stages in the 
sequence of events leading up to the Coronation of the Virgin 
in the way that Nadal did, nor that he intended his painting 
  to be given the same title as Hieronymus Wierix's print. I t  
is likely that he did not, and he may simply have used the 
print because it seemed a pictorial invention which suited 
the iconographic terms of his commission. But there can be 
no doubt of Rubens's indebtedness to it, for the puzzling top 
half of his composition at any rate (despite some differences, 
the bottom half comes closer to traditional forms). Not only 
is the Virgin placed on a lower level on Christ's right (as 
required by the text cited above) in almost identical poses 
and the same relation to each other, but the arrangement of 
 clouds and angels is strikingly similar. On  the lower bank of 
clouds are the younger putto-like angels (represented by 
heads only in the print), while the older ones are arranged 
on clouds which extend diagonally to the topmost corners 
of the print, exactly as in the work by Rubens. Admittedly, 
they do not play musical instruments in the engraving, but 
their music-making activity is insisted upon a number of 
times by both the annotations and the explanatory text.16 
  I t  should perhaps be noted that Wierix's print presents the 
Virgin's sepulchre as securely closed (in contrast to Rubens, 
who shows the rolling away of the stone), and she stands on 
the crescent.17 But for the rest the similarities are very close.18 
 In  itself the relationship between Rubens's modello and 
 the Wierix print is not an  especially significant discovery; 
but the immediate context of the print has wide-ranging 
 implications, especially in terms of the issues raised at  the 
beginning of this discussion. 
Nadal's book, written at the instigation of St Ignatius 
 himself,19 may at  first sight seem to be only one of the many 
aids to meditation which were published in the wake of the 
Spiritual Exer~ises.~~ (as Buser has recentlyBut Thomas

tione (more briefly on the plate as Excipit eam Christus gratulatione summa).

 preliminary study - in the panels of the Music-making Angels in Liechtenstein

l8 Although the holy women -whose presence is explicable on the iconographic 
 grounds referred to in note 6 above - are absent in the engraving, it should be 
noted that they are present in the two preceding scenes of the Death and Burial, 
 (Pl. I 50--51). In the light of their presence there, Rubens may have felt there 
 was no reason to omit them at the very following event - apart from the 
aesthetic grounds he may have had for their inclusion. 
lB The opening sentence of the first preface (unpaginated) to the book makes 
this clear: 'Dixerat aliquando, Beatissime Pater, Hieronymo Natali, uni ex suis 
alumnis, Parens nostrae Societatis Ignatius, operae pretium facturum eum, qui ad 
perpetuam atque paratam Religiosis eiusdem Societatis scholaribus meditandi, orandique

capita meditantium utitlitati accomodata redigeret; neque id solum, sed etiam appositis

     tionship between Nadal and St Ignatius is J. ~ U R E D AI BLANES: Sant Zgnasi i

NICOLAU cited in note 12 above.

stressed21) the significance of this popular work lay in the 
emphasis placed on the illustrations and on their r61e in the 
meditative process. These illustrations, of which there are 
153 grouped together at the end of the text, were each pro- 
vided with a sequence of letters (usually between four and 
six) placed close to the chief incidents or elements in the 
composition. The captions below each print in turn provided 
a short explanation of these letters. But the real importance 
for the reader of this system of annotation only becomes 
apparent when one consults the text. This is divided into 
chapters (arranged according to the gospel readings of the 
entire year) bearing the same titles as the illustrations. 
Each chapter (conceived as a meditatio) contains, in the 
first place, a short adnotatiuncula corresponding to the caption 
beneath the relevant print. There then follows a much longer 
adnotatio which, although it is still arranged according to the 
letters on the print, contains an expanded meditation on 
each of the elements therein, as well as on the print as a 
whole. 
How, then, was the book intended to be used? What was 
  the r61e assigned to the illustrations? I t  is worth asking 
these questions, not only because this system of annotation 
was adopted, whether in a modified form or not, in a whole 
series of some of the most popular devotional works in the 
Netherlandsz2 but also because it provides an insight into 
an important aspect of the function of images in the late 
sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Fortunately, an 
almost complete answer to these questions may be found in 
the two prefaces (or the foreword and the preface) to the 
 text. The first, to Clement VIII  and signed by Jacobus 
Ximenes (Diego JimCnez), makes it clear that the work was 
originally intended for members and novices of the Jesuit 
order, with the illustrations to be used as an aid to medita- 
      t i ~ n . ~ ~What is significant, however, is the concern displayed 
for the quality of the illustrations : deliberate care was taken 
that they should not be engraved by an unattractive hand, 
and cause boredom by the very multitude of images. They 
were to be as skilled, elegant and attractive as possible, and 
by the best possible artists, in order to encourage assiduous 
 meditation.24 To  achieve the required quality, great ex-
pense was involved, and a number of difficulties encountered 
in the process, but these were finally overcome.26 Here is a 
clear statement of the validity and purposes of art in a re- 
 ligious context, in an age when - certainly from a Protestant

 point of view and usually from a Catholic - pictorial imagery 
was consistently underplayed in favour of a renewed em-
phasis on words, or specific texts.26 What is important here, 
and without which this work would be unthinkable, are the 
illustrations. They are to be the very basis of the meditative 
 process - and one is dealing here with real images, not the 
  mental images of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises. I t  is an aware- 
ness of the fact that art preceded the calling up of mental 
images. 
The second preface (to the reader; present in the edition 
of 1607 but absent in the earlier ones) makes it clear that the 
work had now been adapted for wider circulation.27 And 
because further guidelines might be needed on how to 
meditate on each image (and on what, therefore, to think), 
the decision was taken to include an adnotatio not only 
below each picture but also an expanded one in the body of 
each chapter, along with the appropriate section from the 
  Gospel.28 I t  is precisely these adnotationes which enable the 
art historian to gain some idea of how the seventeenth 
century 'read' these images; and with the Life of Christ 
divided into 153 different scenes one is thus provided with an 
insight into how almost every religious representation within 
this cycle would have affected the beholder, and what sorts 
of associations were open to him.2s 
 In  the case of the image to which Rubens was indebted in 
the Leningrad modello, the print headed Suscitatur Virgo 
Muter a Filio (Fig.6) is, as we have noted, the third of four 
scenes dealing with the Virgin. We need not here deal with 
the first two, illustrating the death and burial of the Virgin, 
but it should be noted that all four scenes are dealt with in the 
final and longest section of the text, subsumed under the 
general heading of The Assumption of the Virgin. Fifty-three 
closely printed folio pages of double column text deal with 
this subject as a wh0le.3~ But to return to the adnotatio to 
     the particular print under d i scu~s ion .~~  Here the explanatory 
caption of the print (and the identical adnotatiuncula in the 
text) is expanded by the addition of words and whole 
phrases, which not only enlarge the description of the various 
elements in the scene, and call into play a range of purely 
theological associations, but are also sensual and emotive.

But see the proviso regarding psychological associations at the conclusion of 
the first paragraph here, as well as those engendered by the aesthetic aspects 
of the work of art on p.441 below. I am aware that much of what follows could 
be found in any number of texts, ranging from patristic sources through 
medieval devotional practices to seventeenth-century meditational handbooks. 
But we are here concerned specifically with an audience such as Rubens might 
 have had - even though they might, either consciously or unconsciously, have 
been acquainted with related manifestations of the same tradition.

The adnotatio is deliberately calculated to help the reader 
realize the emotional qualities which the image is likely (or 
supposed) to arouse. This may be achieved quite simply, as 
in the case of the annotation to the sepulchre of the Virgin 
(marked B on the print), where the simple caption 'Christ 
rouses his Mother from the closed tomb and heaps the 
greatest gifts upon her body and becomes 'He 
(re)joins the soul of his Mother with her body, and both body 
and soul are filled with the most excellent honours and gifts; 
and straightway he brings his Mother forth from the closed 
tomb'.33 The piling up of synonyms (which may of course be 
found in other devotional treatises, especially Jesuit ones) 
and the addition of evocative words (here simply 'straight- 
way') are intended to stir the emotions of the beholder and 
are carried to a greater pitch in the annotations which 
follow. When one looks upon the Virgin (here marked by the 
letter C) one sees her 'coming forth with the most radiant 
garment of immortality, adorned with glory, surrounded by 
a variety of honours and gifts, golden and blessed . . .'34 
'The Son welcomes his Mother [D on the print between the 
two figures, indicating the act of welcoming] with ineffable 
happiness and immense joy'.35 When one's eyes turn to the 
hosts of angels (E),one observes that 'they and all the other 
blessed spirits pay homage and do reverence to her, the 
Queen and Mistress of heaven and all the earth, the Mother 
of omnipotent God'.36 While Rubens has omitted the 
crescent on which the Virgin stands, his portrayal of the 
upper half of the scene seems to follow these descriptions 
almost exactly: not only is the Virgin surrounded by an 
effulgence the quality of which it is impossible to imagine 
any other artist in the Netherlands attaining, it is almost as 
if he has tried to evoke the same psychological relations 
described by Nadal. But it is always difficult to describe the 
pictorialization of emotional moment^,^' and it may be 
that our perceptions of these have only been made possible 
by the verbal ones in the text. In any event it is the latter 
which has provided some clues as to how a seventeenth-
century beholder might have responded to the picture. 
  I t  is worth proceeding to the next section in Nadal's 
book, to the adnotatio for the last plate in the book, repre- 
senting the Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin (Fig.5), 
not only because it helps to explain a puzzling iconographic 
feature of the lower half of Rubens's work, but also because 
it casts light on all of his later Assumptions. 
We may note in passing the description of the angels (B) 
in this print, which is similar to the preceding description, 
but still further expanded. 'An escort of angels of all ranks 
encircles her, along with other sacred spirits, rejoicing and 
making music. With this most brilliant celestial and divine 
triumph, the Virgin Mother of God is carried up to the

heavenly empyrean'38 and so on. While this description may 
seem to apply particularly to the Leningrad modello, it is no 
 accident that in all his Assumptions, Rubens shows at  least 
two different types of angels, and sometimes more (angelicae 
omnium ordinum cohortes cum sanctis aliis spiritibus psallentes 
ac iubilantes). Letter Cis placed adjacent to the Coronation by 
 the Trinity at  the very top of the print. As this moment does 
not appear within any of Rubens's paintings of the Assump- 
tion, we need not dwell on it here; but it should be observed 
that the exceptionally long accompanying adnotatio 
emphasizes the relationship of the Virgin to each of the 
persons of the Trinity: she kneels before the Father with 
whom she conceived her eternal son, before the Son whom 
she conceived, gave birth to, fed and nourished, before the 
Spirit cuius operatione tY uirtute Filium Dei conceper~t.~~ Here 
almost the full range of associations that the Virgin was 
capable of arousing is evoked; and in order to do so, there is 
no eschewing of emotive phrases like (Filius) quem conceperat, 
    genuerat, nut r i~era t .~~ Indeed, this sort of emotive evocation is 
the hallmark of much of the work. The Virgin's exultant 
elevation is emphasized, but so is her humility before her 
Lord. 
The letter E marks the rocky sepulchre of the Virgin, and 
in the annotation may be found a partial explanation for 
Rubens's usual decision to show the tomb as being open 
(instead of being firmly locked, as in the preceding print): 
'Once the sepulchre was opened, they did not find the body, but 
only those things with which she was buried'.41 And it goes 
on to arouse not only the emotions, but also the senses. That 
of hearing has already been mentioned; now it is the sense of 
smell. When one saw the sepulchre, one was put in mind of 
the fact that the apostles were 'filled with the wonderfully 
sweet fragrance coming from the tomb; so they lifted their 
eyes, and bodies and souls upwards to contemplate the 
resurrection, assumption and glory of the most blessed 
Virgin . . .'42 
While it is not necessary to suggest that Rubens followed 
precisely this text, it should be borne in mind that in these 
respects all his paintings of the Assumption follow it far more 
closely than do the engravings by Wierix. There are, it is 
true, some additional elements in the paintings, like the 
miracle of the roses (an attractive part of the tradition found 
in the Golden Legend43 which Rubens found difficult to resist), 
'Circumvolant Angelicae omnium ordinum cohortes cum sanctis aliis spiritibus 
psallentes ac iubilantes. Cum hoc triumph praeclarissimo, caelesti, divino evehitur ad 
caelum empyreum Virgo Dei parens: ei Angeli, & species creatas gubemantes, ti3 
caelorum motores transeunti genua curvant, & obedientiam &ferunt Reginae suae ti3 
Dominae', NATALIS,0). cit., p.587. 
SB 'Genibus nixa divina Virgo adorat trinum Deum t3 unum: Patrem, qui cum Filium 
aeternum genuisset, eum&m ipsi &&rat generandum; Filium quem conceperat, gcnuerat, 
lactaverat, nutriverat, subditum in tern's habuerat & obedientiam; Spiritum sanctum, 
cuius operatione & virtute Filium Dei conceperat', Ibid.; Something like these 
 notions may also be found in earlier texts - compare, for example, the Golden 
Legend, ed. cit., p.100.

preceding note).

but these would only have served to enhance the associations 
 - in this case, for example, of' the sweet smell coming from 
 the tomb - indicated by Nadal's text. 
All this is followed in the last chapter of the book by a long 
   final meditation D e  Virginis Deiparae Laudibus. In  its forty- 
eight pages (pp.586-636) every aspect of the Virgin's 
Assumption is dwelt upon in a series of headed paragraphs. 
Every possible relationship is brought into play, every pos- 
sible epithet used to describe the Virgin or the significance of 
the event. Here, for example, may be found the whole range 
of references to the Song of Solomon, the Old Testament 
text most frequently drawn upon for its sensual prefiguration 
of the Virgin and her relationship with Christ, God, and the 
Trinity44 (it is worth recalling that the basis for the identifica- 
tion of the Leningrad modello with the project of 161I is the 
fact that Otto van Veen's rival modello represented 'Christ 
calling his bride from Lebanon to be crowned', in other 
 words the Coronation of the Virgin - referred to, as it often 
was, in terms of the Song of Songs45). Certain passages are 
analysed at extraordinary length. Each word of the phrase 
 Ecce tu  pulchra es is elaborated into an expansion of the idea 
contained in the sentence as a whole, in an almost scholastic 
way.46 Indeed, the Virgin's beauty forms the main burden 
of many of these paragraphs, in a manner that seems to the 
present-day reader to call out for pictorial realization. And 
so it seemed to Nadal as well, as we may judge from the 
prefaces.47 He realized, in a way that the writers of other 
meditational works did not, that pictorial images could take 
priority over literary ones, and could be used to stimulate the 
further visualization of everything that was written out at 
length in these pages. The chapter concludes by listing not 
only the evangelical but also the patristic statements related 
            to the A s s ~ m p t i o n , ~ ~and emphasizes the inevitable parallelism 
between the Virgin and the Church (the VirgolEcclesia 
               r e l a t i ~ n s h i p ) . ~ ~One could scarcely wish for fuller evidence 
of the possible range of associations available to the beholder 
of the images of the Assumption with which we have here 
been concerned. 50

   45  Cf. VAN DE VELDE,op. tit., p.252, note I I ,  for the reference to the modello 
'quae Dominum nostrum sponsam suam de Libano provocantem ad coronam continet' by 
van Veen; for the use of the famous passage 'Veni de Libano sponsa mea, ueni de 
Libano veni: coronaberis de capite Amana . . .' from Cant. 4:8, and its use in the 
early texts, see A. KATZENELLENBOGEN: The Sculptural Programs of Chartres 
Cathedral, Baltimore [1g5g], pp.56-60, and the valuable notes on pp.125-30 
with references not only to the early sources, but also to modern texts dealing 
with the subject of the Assumption of the Virgin. 
   46 Thus 'Ecce: rem raram admirabilem singularem; T u :  nulla alia tam pulchra' and 
   so on, NATALIS, o f .  tit., p.592. Earlier, in his twentieth Coimbran sermon of 
1561, Kadal had recommended a similar way of meditating on the words 
'Pater noster qui es', although naturally these offered less scope for visualisation: 
cf. NICOLAU'S edition of the Platicas Espirituales cited in note 20 above, p.195. 
Similar, too, are the methods of some of the Spanish mystics, as for example, in 
St john of the Cross: Cantico Espiritual.

pp.127-33 provide a valuable fund of sources for the parallelism between the 
Virgin and The Church in the context of the Assumption and Coronation of 
the Virgin.

considerably; cf. below p.440.

The importance of Nadal's work lies in its use of detailed 
illustrations and the relationship of text to image. But there 
are other meditational handbooks of the time which, even if 
they are not illustrated themselves, may be used to cast light 
  on the response to images. I t  is not only for this reason, but 
also because several aspects of Rubens's paintings which do 
not feature prominently in Natalis are further clarified, that 
it seems worth examining one such handbook. We may turn 
             to one of the many works by Franciscus C ~ s t e r u s , ~ ~  the D e  
Vita et Laudibus Deiparae Mariae Virginis Meditationes Quin-
quaginta,j2 in order to supplement the evidence of Nadal, as 
well as to demonstrate the relationship of the latter with 
other writers of the time. 
The preface to this work insists on the correct method of 
  contemplation - which it then spells out - but in doing so 
draws a parallel with the various ways of responding to 
painted pictures. One could of course respond on different 
levels, from the superficial to the profound. Coster puts it 
briefly: 'Just as it is of great import whether we look at a 
painting casually or intently, in passing or directly, atten- 
tively or thinking of something else, whether we are moved 
or we admire the art,j3 so it is of great importance that we 
meditate on the Virgin with a definite method'.j4 How did 
this 'method' operate? Although it is spelt out in rather 
diffuse detail in this preface, it is systematically exemplified, 
with great precision, in the body of the text. The subject of 
each of the fifty meditations is carefully divided into its 
constituent elements. These are further subdivided accord- 
ing to the various issues they raise: every moment in the 
event and every emotional juncture is considered, in a strict 
system of enumeration. Each subdivision beings with the 
  injunction 'Consider', followed by a series of numbers. I t  is 
a method (whose origin may be found in medieval handbooks 
such as those attributed to St Bonaventure as well as in the 
practice of meditating on the Rosary) which demands that 
the reader calls up before himself a specific mental image; 
  and this image then provides the basis for meditation. I t  is 
the same function which is assigned to the composicidn uiendo 
el lugar of the Ignatian exercises. By these means, therefore, 
the work compensates for its lack of physical images; and the 
system of numbering each division (i.e. each image) and

  5 3  This distinction seemed to be especially important to theological com-
mentators on art in general in the sixteenth century; in the case of an artist 
such as Rubens it must have seemed crucial (although a modern observer 
might argue against the existence of the distinction at all). For a similar con- 
cern over the possibility that the beholder might be more aesthetically than 
 spiritually moved, cf. the remarks at  the end of the Preface to the Reader in 
Nadal's work: 'ad spiritualem fructum . . . non satis esse imagines curiose pervoluere, 
aut illarum artem & pulchritudinem admirari; sed in singulis esse tibi singulos, vel 
etiam plures dies insistendum, Adnotationum & Meditationum capita sensim perlegenda,

vations about the effects of works of art by other writers in the sixteenth 
century, see my article cited in note 26 above.

each subdivision (i.e. each of the thoughts the former 
 arouses) corresponds to the use of letters In Nadal - except 
that the use of numbers enables Coster to be still more precise 
about every component of the meditational process, a fact 
necessitated to some extent by the absence of illustrations. 
The Meditation on the Death of the Virgin is divided into 
 three sections - on the events preceding her death, on her 
death itself, and on her In the last section one finds 
again an emphasis on the sensual aspects of the image. Here 
too the musical component is emphasized, as well as the 
glorious light that pervaded the scene, and the sweet-smell- 
ing flowers spread by the apostles. These are sensual flowers, 
but they are also metaphysical ones (for they are the flowers 
of the Virgin's virtues).5s Similarly, the apostles light real 
torches as they accompany her bier, but divine light 
('because while she lived the Virgin was the light of the 
World') 57 pervades the scene, and so on. 
In the Meditation on the Assumption itself, the first point to 
consider, according to Coster, is the welcome accorded by 
Christ to His Mother.58 The emotional component is even 
stronger than in the related passage in Nadal, but our feel- 
ings are aroused by dwelling on the same things. Although 
the description of Christ kissing His Mother and wiping away 
her tears59 is not to be found in Nadal (nor represented in 
paintings) it is followed by an insistence on recollecting 
Christ's relationship with His Mother in His infancy which 
we have already noted. By these kisses Christ repays those 
maternal ones frequently given to Him as a child; now he 
reciprocates His Mother's action in wiping away His 
childish tears; He recalls how she cradled him in her arms, 
gave him to suck, nurtured and fostered Him.so There is

in NATALIS quoted in note 39 above. They may depend ultimately on the 
passage in LUKE XI, 27: 'Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps 
which thou hast sucked', but there is probably some influence here from the 
traditional iconography of the Intercession of the Virgin, where she appeals to 
Christ's mercy by revealing her breast. See the engraving by E. van Panderen 
after Rubens of this subject, with the caption: '. . . Ostendit Mater Filio pectus et 
 ubera: . . . Quomodo poterit ibi esse ulla repulsa, ubi tot sunt charitates insignia' (c.  G. 
VOORHELM SCHNEEVOOGT: P. P. Rubens,Catalogue des Estampes gravies d'apr2s 
Haarlem [1873], pp.92-93, No.163). The source of this text was a late tenth- 
century text attributed to the Patriarch Germanos of Constantinople (P.G., 
XCVIII, co1.399), where the Virgin's breasts are compared to the chalices 
of the eucharistic sacrifice, but it is actually a quotation from a twelfth-century 
text by Arnaldus of Chartres (P.L., CLXXXIX, coIs.1725-26), which was 
      then adapted in the Speculum Humanae Salvationis, Chapter L X I X  (see J .  LUTZ 
AND P. PERDRIZET: KritischeSpeculum Humanae Salvationis, Ausgabe, Leipzig 
[1907], pp.297, 301--02). For an illuminating discussion of the motif see

much in a similar mood in the Spanish mystics.s1 The joy of 
this reunion having been considered, the second considera- 
tion is the glorious entry of the Virgin into Heaven;62 the 
third consideration her welcome by the heavenly hosts 
(with more references to the Song of Songs).63 We wonder at 
I : the glory accorded to her by the sterile world (an allusion 
to the desertum referred to in Canticles 6 and 8), 2: the 
 spiritual delights gained thereby, 3 : the honour she deserves 
in heaven.s4 
The next section of this meditation on the Assumption, De 
Assumptione Corpo~is,~~ need not detain us, but it is worth 
noting in the light of the long-standing discussion about the 
distinctions between the Assumption of the Soul and that of 
the Body.ss This is followed by a section De Corpore non 
inventos7 which is of more direct relevance to the Leningrad 
  modello. I t  deals with Thomas's doubt about the miracle (of 
her passage from the closed tomb) and explains that once 
the sepulchre was opened, 'nothing was found except the 
          funeral shroud', in which Christ too had been ~ r a p p e d . ~ e  
Here is a sufficient explanation for the rolling away of the 
tombstone in the Leningrad modello, and the careful repre- 
sentation, in all Rubens's Assumptions, of the examination 
of the shroud. 
The final twelve meditations in the book are devoted to 
each of the stars (the twelve stars referred to in Revelation 
 I 2 :I) of the Virgin's crown. Each one is taken to signify a 
particular virtue, from the generic (the first star equated 
with Fides, the second with Contemplatio) to the specific (the 
twelfth star seen in terms of the positive aspects of matrimony, 
De Bonis Matrimonii) .s9 And the symbolic significance of each 
star is spelt out in great detail. Here the meditative process 
  and the associative method are carried to greatest length. I t  
is unlikely that more than a small number of adepts pondered 
images of the Assumption to the extent of dwelling carefully 
on each of the stars of the Virgin's crown70 (and many

representations of the Coronation do not show them), but the 
fact that this was possible at all provides a remarkable 
demonstration of the psychological complexity of the response 
to images. Even if subliminal associations, and those which 
have nothing to do with religion are omitted, the complexity 
of choice open to the beholder of images in the seventeenth 
century could not be more clearly attested. 
Now in purely psychological terms all this is perhaps 
rather obvious, and the foregoing may seem to be couched 
in terms of truisms which need not be analysed. But the aim 
of this article is to show that the response to images is 
amenable to historical investigation as well, and to a greater 
extent than is generally recognized. There is no reason 
(other than the difficulty involved) why art historians should 
not be concerned with the response of people who did not 
actually write about such matters.71 But here we are con- 
fronted again with the full weight of the problems which an 
analysis of this kind must raise. 
The two texts I have considered were both written by 
Jesuits, and for fairly specific groups. Nadal's work was 
   originally written for a Jesuit a~d ience ,~2  and for novices in 
particular, while Coster's book was intended for the young 
(male) members of the Sodality of the Virgin at the 
College in Douai.73 But we know from the prefaces to 
Nadal's book that it had a wider circulation than the 
audience for whom it was at first conceived, and there can be 
no doubt that the same applies to the work by Coster, one 
of the most popular and prolific writers of small devotional 
handbooks in the later sixteenth and early seventeenth 
 centuries. 74  NOW although both works would only have been 
immediately accessible to the Latin reading public, they 
provide evidence of a mode of response which was not 
restricted to this audience alone. They are not, of course, 
unique; indeed, their value depends on their very typicality. 
They may be counted amongst the most representative 
works in this period of a tradition which has its roots in much 
earlier meditational methods (there are some striking 
similarities, for example, with the Meditationes de Vita 
              Christi attributed to St B ~ n a v e n t u r e ~ ~ )  and which found its 
expression in a great variety of outlets, ranging from 
meditations on the rosary to the Spiritual Exercises of St 
Ignatius Loyola, as well as to the meditative practices of 
  7 1  I hope to deal elsewhere with further aspects of this problem, and in par- 
ticular with what may be deduced from the strictures of the literate on the 
responses of the illiterate.

Translated by Isa Ragusa, completed from the Latin and edited by R. B. GREEN

representations of the Passion which takes into consideration meditational and 
other literature, and which raises several of the problems outlined here (in 
addition to raising further notable issues such as the whole question of the use 
of Old Testament imagery in New Testament contexts), see J. MARROW:

the other religious orders.76 But the works discussed here 
are two of the fullest and most complex handbooks of the 
Counter Reformation in Flanders, with the clearest exposi- 
tion of their subject-matter. Nadal's book is, of course, of 
special relevance, as I suggested at the beginning of this 
article, not only because of its use of actual images and their 
relationship with paintings by Rubens, but also because of 
its sophisticated method of annotating these illustrations. In 
this it was followed by many other works, such as the even 
more popular books by Johannes David, Antonio Sucquet 
and Jodocus Andries, all of which were translated into the 
vernacular, thus ensuring a still wider audience. But the 
evidence they provide is much less complete, and their 
illustrations of a decidedly lower quality.77 The fact that 
Coster's book was written specifically for youths, rather than 
restricting its applicability (as one may at first be inclined 
to think) makes it all the more useful, precisely because it 
has to spell out all the guidelines for minds not yet practised 
or proficient in the associative process. 
At this point one may encounter several objections which 
 an analysis of this kind is likely to raise. In  the first place, 
have we not here been dealing with the responses of 
 theologians or, at  best, the responses which they would have 
liked to be present in the minds of the populace? In other 
words, is there not a distinction to be made between what 
writers such as Nadal and Coster wanted people to think and 
what associations they actually made? The answer is surely 
that the distinction cannot have been so absolute that there 
 was no common ground between them - especially where 
one is concerned with popular and thoroughly known sub- 
   7 6  One thinks especially of DAVID'S Veridicus Christianus, Antwerp [I  60 I], trans- 
lated as Christelycken Waerseggher, de principale stucken uan t' Christen Geloof en 
 Leven int cort begrijpende, Met  een rolle der deugtsaemheyt daer op dienende. Ende een

formetur in nobis, Antwerp [1607], 8'; and his Duodecim Specula, Deum aliquando 
       videre desidcranti concinnati, Antwerp [ I ~ I O ] ,  8O (all from the Plantin press); of 
SUCQUET'S Via vitae aeternae . . . iconibus illustrata per Boetium a Bolswert, Antwerp, 
         M .  Nutius [ I ~ z o ] ,  8O, translated as Den wech des Eeuwich Levens, Antwerp, 
  H .  Aertssens [1623]; and of ANDRIES'S Necessaria ad salutem scientia, partim 
necessitate medii, partim necessitate graecepti, per iconas quinquaginta duas repraesentata, 
      Antwerp, C .  Woons [I  6541, I 2'; and his Perpetua C m ,  sive Passio Jesu Christi 
a puncto Incatnationis ad extremum vitae; iconibus quadragemi explicata (together with 
Altera perpetua crux 3esu Christi a fine vitae usque ad finem mundi in perpetuo altaris 
sacrificio), Antwerp, C. Woons [1649], translated as Het ghederigh Kruys ofte 
Passie Zesu Christi, Antwerp, C. Woons [1650]. Most of these received a number 
of subsequent editions and translations into other languages. The works of 
David and Sucquet have often been called emblem books, but the description 
is perhaps not entirely accurate. The above is only a small selection of these 
author's works; for their other writings, and for concise discussions of their 
lives, see, in the case of David (1545-1613)~ F. A. in BibliographicSNELLAERT, 
Nationale de Belgique, IV, Brussels [1873], cols.7n1-32; in the case of Sucquet 
(1574-1626), A. PONCELET,Ibid., XXIV, Brussels [1g26--291, cols.237-41;

 Jesuits - are referred to briefly in the work by NICOLAU cited in note 12 above, 
PP. '74-9 
  7 7  Although David in particular merits further analysis, for the evidence that 
may be found in his works of other aspects of the response to images, especially 
the sorts of allegorical interpretations current amongst the less visually sophisti- 
cated sections of the public. 

                                                               A S O U R C E  F O R  R U B E N S ' S  M O D E L L O  O F  T H E  A S S U M P T I O N  A N D  C O R O N A T I O N  O F  T H E  V I R G I N  
       j e c t ~ . ' ~And here a further problem may arise. Clearly, in 
the case of a subject like the Assumption, where the pictorial, 
literary, and liturgical tradition is of so wide-ranging a 
nature it would be impossible to determine all the thoughts 
which such a subject might have generated, or to isolate 
them. Social groups must also be a determining factor, and 
I am aware that I have omitted reflections which could have 
been engendered by the purely aesthetic qualities of the 
 work of art concerned - an omission which may be especially 
serious in the case of Rubens. But despite the particular 
affiliations of the writers I have considered, they are in- 
separable from the general cultural matrix, and they offer 
meticulous documentation of notions which were current 
but which would otherwise not have been committed to 
paper (to a large extent because they were taken for granted). 
  On  the other hand - and here one encounters a third 
 objection - it might be argued that few would have paused 
long enough before a particular work of art to make any of 
the associations suggested above; perhaps, it might be main- 
tained, most people bestowed no more attention on an image 
of the Assumption than they do in any small village in one of 
the Catholic countries now. But we are concerned precisely 
with those who did pause to look, for however long; and I 
suspect that this argument is an oversimplification of the 
question of the response to images, even today. Religious 
images always partake of at least some totemic or super-
natural qualities. People may not consciously be aware of 
 the associations they make when they see an  image; they 
may even appear to be more concerned with other things 
  7 8  On the other hand, account has to be taken of the possibility of garbling even 
the most common and well-established traditions. Just how easily this could 
happen (in the case of those who were not widely literate but drew on only 
a few texts for their learning) may be seen in the remarkable example of the 
miller of the Friuli whose testimony before the Inquisition in the 1580's has 
been documented by c. GINZB~RG:I1 Formaggio e i Venni, I1 Cosmo di un mugnaio 
del Cinquecento, Turin [19361. 
(even if they are not obviously impressed by its aesthetic 
qualities). But no mind could free itself of all the associations 
that any image, especially a religious one, generated. These 
are complex psychological questions, but they have a his-
torical dimension which art historians have for too long over- 
looked. Why are some images more venerated than others? 
What is the relationship between the works of artists acknow- 
ledged to be great and popular prints? Between art and 
pilgrimage, art and healing objects and relics, between art 
 and iconoclasm - to mention only a few possibilities? But 
such matters must be dealt with separately. Here I have 
simply been concerned with one aspect of the status of 
images in the seventeenth century and the response to them. 
It would be wrong to imply that this is anything else but one 
of many ways of looking at such problems. 
In a field already encumbered with a bibliography larger 
than most, this article is intended to be no more than a 
proposal of the direction which future research might take. 
Instead of the manufacture of increasing numbers of attri- 
butions, or the seeking out of yet more influences (both of 
which areas have been well developed), one might turn to 
the more immediate context of the art of Rubens. There is 
much to be discovered about the ways in which people of 
all social classes and groups responded to it. Most of the 
illustrated books and devotional literature of his time 
remain to be explored and would repay close reading. 
Examination and analysis of these, as well as of run of the 
mill graphic production in the Southern Netherlands will 
yield much not only about popular response to religious 
subjects, but also about levels of expectation, about atti- 
tudes to the greatest artists of the time, and so on. The pre- 
ceding discussion has been intended merely as a sketch of 
one of the ways in which the vast and still largely unexplored 
field of seventeenth-century Flemish imagery may be used 
to illuminate the status of those works of art which are 
already and rightly well known.

The Agdollo Collection of Paintings: an inventory of 1741 
   T H E  name of Gregorio Agdollo as an art collector in Florence 
during the late I 730's appears in the printed catalogue of an 
  exhibition which took place in that city in 1737.~ O n  that 
occasion Agdollo contributed seven picture^.^ 
The complete list of his collection is now available to 
scholar^,^ having been found among the papers of a Floren- 
tine family. Agdollo's collection was to have been acquired 
by this family but, as we shall see later, adverse circum- 
stances prevented this. 
By the time of the inventory of 24th April 1741, the 
'Nota dei Quadri e Opere di Scultura esposti per la Festa di Sun Luca dell' Accademia 
del Disegno nclla loro Cappella e nel Chiostro second0 del Convento dei Padn' della 
SS. Nonriata di Firenze, Florence [1737].

  Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorisches Znstitut in Florenz [1g74], I ,  p.136. Five out of 
the seven works exhibited in 1737 are to be found in the r 741 inventory. 
See Document No.11. 
Agdollo collection numbered seventy-eight pictures by 
thirty-seven artists, all specified except for one case. The 
predominance of seventeenth and eighteenth-century artists 
reveals the collector's personal taste, especially for Baroque 
art. However, the Renaissance was also represented by a 
few but celebrated names: Schiavone, Sarto, Veronese, 
Titian. The Baroque examples range from the most famous 
names, such as Reni, Rubens and Poussin, to minor or quite 
unknown masters such as Monsieur Pitrt (probably French) 
whose name I have been unable to find in any of the con- 
temporary artistic repertories. 
The number of pictures by a given artist in the collection 
varies from a maximum of seven paintings to a sihgle 
example. 
This inventory is a model of its kind because with rare 
exceptions it is accompanied by the essential information: 
the subject represented, dimensions and name of the author. 
No monetary estimates were made, but for the most import-
