Major correspondents include Leland Stanford; Frederick Law Olmsted and J. C. Olmsted, landscape architects; John McMillan, supervising engineer at the Stanford construction site; Charles Lathrop, Business Manager, Stanford University; Charles Edward Hodges, draughtsman and later resident architect; Thomas H. Douglas, nurseryman; Henry S. Codman, Olmsted partner; Joseph Lamb, manufacturer of stained glass windows; and Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, architectural firm. The collection also contains some photocopies of Olmsted correspondence.</p>

            <p>This collection contains material acquired from a variety of sources. The Olmsted-McMillan correspndence came to the Archives sometime before 1965, source unknown. The letters from the Olmsted firm to Emory Smith and the copies of Frederick Law Olmsted's letters provided by the Olmsted firm form another group of records, which seem to have come to the Stanford Collection (precursor of the University Archives) through Orrin Leslie Elliott, first University "historian." The Charles Edward Hodges, Joseph Lamb, and Charles Lathrop letters were included in a group of materials purchased in 1972 from Frank Spingola of San Francisco (with funds provided by Mr. David Canfield, Santa Fe). In 1976, photocopies of correspondence in the Frederick L. Olmsted papers and the Olmsted Associates papers, both in the Library of Congress, were ordered and received to expedite research for the "Founders and Architects" exhibit.</p>
